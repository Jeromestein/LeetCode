`Unknown`

You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` rooms numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [starti, endi]` means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval `[starti, endi)`. All the values of `starti` are **unique**.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

1. Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.
2. If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.
3. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.

Return _the **number** of the room that held the most meetings._ If there are multiple rooms, return _the room with the **lowest** number._

A **half-closed interval** `[a, b)` is the interval between `a` and `b` **including** `a` and **not including** `b`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1. 
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 105`
- `meetings[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 105`
- All the values of `starti` are **unique**.

        return meeting_count.index(max(meeting_count))

## Complexity Analysis

Let N be the number of rooms.  
Let M be the number of meetings.

- Time complexity: O(M⋅logM+M⋅logN). Sorting meetings will incur a time complexity of O(M⋅logM). Popping and pushing into the priority queue will each cost O(logN). These priority queue operations run inside a for loop that runs at most M times leading to a time complexity of O(M⋅logN).  
    The inner nested loop will incur a time complexity of O(logN). The combined time complexity will be O(M⋅logM+M⋅logN). As per the constraints N is small, the term O(M⋅logM) will dominate.  
    **Note**: Initializing `unused_rooms` will cost O(N) in ruby and python. But will cost O(N⋅logN) in C++ and Java due to the implementation.
    
- Space complexity: O(N+sort). Initializing `unused_rooms` and `meeting_count` will incur a space complexity of O(N). Some extra space is used when we sort an array of size N in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
    
    - In Python, the `sort` method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has a space complexity of O(N).
    - In C++, the sort() function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of O(logN).
    - In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of O(logN).
