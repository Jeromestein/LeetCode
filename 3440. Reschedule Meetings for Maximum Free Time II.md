You are given an integer `eventTime` denoting the duration of an event. You are also given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, each of length `n`.

These represent the start and end times of `n` **non-overlapping** meetings that occur during the event between time `t = 0` and time `t = eventTime`, where the `ith` meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]].`

You can reschedule **at most** one meeting by moving its start time while maintaining the **same duration**, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to **maximize** the **longest** _continuous period of free time_ during the event.

Return the **maximum** amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

**Note** that the meetings can **not** be rescheduled to a time outside the event and they should remain non-overlapping.

**Note:** _In this version_, it is **valid** for the relative ordering of the meetings to change after rescheduling one meeting.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** eventTime = 5, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/12/22/example0_rescheduled.png)

Reschedule the meeting at `[1, 2]` to `[2, 3]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 2]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,7,9], endTime = [1,8,10]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/12/22/rescheduled_example0.png)

Reschedule the meeting at `[0, 1]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 7]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,3,7,9], endTime = [1,4,8,10]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/01/28/image3.png)**

Reschedule the meeting at `[3, 4]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[1, 7]`.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** eventTime = 5, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= eventTime <= 109`
- `n == startTime.length == endTime.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime`
- `endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1]` where `i` lies in the range `[0, n - 2]`.

# Intuition

We can either **shift** a meeting into its two adjacent gaps (merging those two gaps) or **jump** it entirely into any non-adjacent gap large enough to hold its full duration. Shifting frees up only the two immediate neighbor gaps; jumping frees up its entire original slot. To decide jumping in O(1) per meeting, we only need to track the three largest gaps globally and check if any of them is non-adjacent and ≥ the meeting’s duration.

# Approach

1. **Prepare data**
    
    - Append `eventTime` to `startTime`, so gaps at all `(i, i+1)` pairs, including the final tail, are `start[i] - end[i-1]` for `i = 0…n`.
2. **Maintain top-3 gaps**
    
    - Use two length-3 arrays: `gaps[0..2]` for the three largest gap sizes, and `ids[0..2]` for their corresponding gap indices.
    - Initialize with the first three gaps, bubble-sort them into descending order.
    - Scan the remaining gaps in one pass: if a new gap ≥ `gaps[0]`, shift the top two down and insert; else if ≥ `gaps[1]`, shift `gaps[1]`→`gaps[2]` and insert; else if > `gaps[2]`, replace it.
3. **Evaluate each meeting**  
    For meeting `i` (0-based):
    
    - Compute its **busy** time: `busy = endTime[i] - startTime[i]`.
    - Compute its **neighbor boundaries**:
        
        ```python
        left  = 0 if i == 0     else endTime[i-1]
        right = eventTime if i == n-1 else startTime[i+1]
        ```
        
    - **Jump check**: scan `k=0..2`, if `gaps[k] >= busy` and `ids[k]` is neither `i` nor `i+1`, then we can jump → free = `right - left`.
    - Otherwise **shift** into neighbors → free = `(right - left) - busy`.
    - Keep the maximum `free` over all `i`.
4. **Return** the maximum free time found.
    

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n) — one pass to collect top-3 gaps, one pass over meetings.
- Space complexity: O(1) — only constant extra arrays of size 3 and a few extra variables.

        start = startTime + [eventTime]
