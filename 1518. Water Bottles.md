There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return _the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`

```python

class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        consumed_bottles = 0

        while numBottles >= numExchange:
            # Maximum number of times we can consume numExchange
            # number of bottles using numBottles.
            K = numBottles // numExchange

            consumed_bottles += numExchange * K
            numBottles -= numExchange * K

            numBottles += K

        return consumed_bottles + numBottles

```
