`Unknown`

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return _the **total frequencies** of elements in_ `nums` _such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency_.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        cnt=Counter(nums)
        res=0
        max_freq=0
        for num,freq in cnt.items():
            if freq>max_freq:
                res=freq
                max_freq=freq
            elif freq==max_freq:
                res+=freq
        return res
