**No-Zero integer** is a positive integer that **does not contain any `0`** in its decimal representation.

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of two integers_ `[a, b]` _where_:

- `a` and `b` are **No-Zero integers**.
- `a + b = n`

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 104`
