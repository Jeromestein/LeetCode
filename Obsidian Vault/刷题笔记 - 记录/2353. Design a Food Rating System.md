Design a food rating system that can do the following:

- **Modify** the rating of a food item listed in the system.
- Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.

Implement the `FoodRatings` class:

- `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.
    - `foods[i]` is the name of the `ith` food,
    - `cuisines[i]` is the type of cuisine of the `ith` food, and
    - `ratings[i]` is the initial rating of the `ith` food.
- `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.
- `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["FoodRatings", "highestRated", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated"]
[[["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], ["korean"], ["japanese"], ["sushi", 16], ["japanese"], ["ramen", 16], ["japanese"]]
Output
[null, "kimchi", "ramen", null, "sushi", null, "ramen"]

Explanation
FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]);
foodRatings.highestRated("korean"); // return "kimchi"
                                    // "kimchi" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
                                      // "ramen" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.
foodRatings.changeRating("sushi", 16); // "sushi" now has a rating of 16.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "sushi"
                                      // "sushi" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.
foodRatings.changeRating("ramen", 16); // "ramen" now has a rating of 16.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
                                      // Both "sushi" and "ramen" have a rating of 16.
                                      // However, "ramen" is lexicographically smaller than "sushi".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length`
- `1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10`
- `foods[i]`, `cuisines[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= ratings[i] <= 108`
- All the strings in `foods` are **distinct**.
- `food` will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to `changeRating`.
- `cuisine` will be a type of cuisine of **at least one** food item in the system across all calls to `highestRated`.
- At most `2 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `changeRating` and `highestRated`.

```python

from sortedcontainers import SortedSet

class FoodRatings:
    def __init__(self, foods: List[str], cuisines: List[str], ratings: List[int]):
        # Map food with its rating.
        self.food_rating_map = {}
        # Map food with the cuisine it belongs to.
        self.food_cuisine_map = {}

        # Store all food of cuisine in a set (to sort them on ratings/name)
        # Set element -> Tuple: (-1 * food_rating, food_name)
        self.cuisine_food_map = defaultdict(SortedSet)

        for i in range(len(foods)):
            # Store 'rating' and 'cuisine' of the current 'food' in 'food_rating_map' and 'food_cuisine_map' maps.
            self.food_rating_map[foods[i]] = ratings[i]
            self.food_cuisine_map[foods[i]] = cuisines[i]
            # Insert the '(-1 * rating, name)' element in the current cuisine's set.
            self.cuisine_food_map[cuisines[i]].add((-ratings[i], foods[i]))

    def changeRating(self, food: str, newRating: int) -> None:
        # Fetch cuisine name for food.
        cuisine_name = self.food_cuisine_map[food]

        # Find and delete the element from the respective cuisine's set.
        old_element = (-self.food_rating_map[food], food)
        self.cuisine_food_map[cuisine_name].remove(old_element)

        # Update food's rating in 'food_rating' map.
        self.food_rating_map[food] = newRating
        # Insert the '(-1 * new rating, name)' element in the respective cuisine's set.
        self.cuisine_food_map[cuisine_name].add((-newRating, food))

    def highestRated(self, cuisine: str) -> str:
        highest_rated = self.cuisine_food_map[cuisine][0]
        # Return name of the highest-rated 'food' of 'cuisine'.
        return highest_rated[1]

```

#### Complexity Analysis

Here, n is the initial size of the `foods` array, and let, m be the number of calls made to `changeRating` and `highestRated` methods.

- Time complexity: O((n+m)logn)
    
    - **Initialization:**
        
        - We iterate over all `foods` elements and insert them into appropriate hash maps and sorted sets. Inserting a value into the hash map takes constant time, but, inserting a value into the sorted set will take logarithmic time.
        - Thus, for n elements, the total time taken will be O(nlogn) time.
    - **changeRating(food, newRating)** method:
        
        - Updating the rating in the hash map will take constant time.
        - But, the sorted set will have n elements, and inserting and deleting an element in it will take O(logn) time.
        - Thus, for m insertions, the total time taken will be O(mlogn) time.
    - **highestRated(cuisine)** method:
        
        - Getting the cuisine name from the hash map is a constant time operation.
        - The sorted set will have n elements, in C++ and Java, getting the min element will take logn time but in Python, it will take O(1) time.
        - Thus, the total time taken for m calls in C++ and Java will be O(mlogn) and in Python will be O(m).
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    - In `foodRatingMap`, `foodCuisineMap`, and `cuisineFoodMap` we will store n elements.
    - Thus, overall it will take O(n) space.
