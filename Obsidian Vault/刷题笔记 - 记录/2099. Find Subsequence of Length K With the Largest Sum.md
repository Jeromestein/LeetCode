`Unknown`

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

Return _**any** such subsequence as an integer array of length_ `k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,3]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
Output: [-1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n=len(nums)
        pairs=[[i, nums[i]] for i in range(n)]
        # sort the pairs by the nums[i] in descending order
        pairs.sort(key=lambda pair:pair[1], reverse=True)
        # get the first k elements
        pairs=pairs[:k]
        # sort the pairs by the index in ascending order
        pairs.sort(key=lambda pair:pair[0])
        return [pair[1] for pair in pairs]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the array nums.

- Time complexity: O(nlogn).
    
    This is the time complexity for sorting the auxiliary array.
    
- Space complexity: O(n).
    
    This is the space overhead of the auxiliary array.
