**Companies**

`Unknown`

You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a **0-indexed** string `customers` consisting only of characters `'N'` and `'Y'`:

- if the `ith` character is `'Y'`, it means that customers come at the `ith` hour
- whereas `'N'` indicates that no customers come at the `ith` hour.

If the shop closes at the `jth` hour (`0 <= j <= n`), the **penalty** is calculated as follows:

- For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.
- For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.

Return _the **earliest** hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a **minimum** penalty._

**Note** that if a shop closes at the `jth` hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour `j`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: customers = "YYNY"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: customers = "NNNNN"
Output: 0
Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 0th hour as no customers arrive.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: customers = "YYYY"
Output: 4
Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 4th hour as customers arrive at each hour.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= customers.length <= 105`
- `customers` consists only of characters `'Y'` and `'N'`.

## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `customers`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    - In each step of the traversal, we update `cur_penalty`, `min_penalty`, and `earliest_hour` based on the character `customers[i]`, which can be done in constant time. Therefore, the traversal takes O(n) time.
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    - We only need to update several parameters, `cur_penalty`, `min_penalty` and `earliest_hour`, which takes O(1) space.
