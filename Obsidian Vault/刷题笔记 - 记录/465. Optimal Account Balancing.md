You are given an array of transactions `transactions` where `transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti]` indicates that the person with `ID = fromi` gave `amounti $` to the person with `ID = toi`.

Return _the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= transactions.length <= 8`
- `transactions[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < 12`
- `fromi != toi`
- `1 <= amounti <= 100`

## Approach 1: Backtracking

```python

class Solution:
    def minTransfers(self, transactions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        balance_map = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for a, b, amount in transactions:
            balance_map[a] += amount
            balance_map[b] -= amount
        
        balance_list = [amount for amount in balance_map.values() if amount!=0]
        n = len(balance_list)
        
        # start from cur-th account, the min transactions we need to clean the debt
        def dfs(cur):
            while cur < n and balance_list[cur]==0:
                cur += 1
            if cur == n:
                return 0
            cost = float('inf')
            for nxt in range(cur + 1, n):
                # If nxt is a valid recipient, do the following: 
                # 1. add cur's balance to nxt.
                # 2. recursively call dfs(cur + 1).
                # 3. remove cur's balance from nxt.
                if balance_list[nxt] * balance_list[cur] < 0:
                    balance_list[nxt] += balance_list[cur]
                    cost = min(cost, 1 + dfs(cur + 1))
                    balance_list[nxt] -= balance_list[cur]
            return cost
        
        return dfs(0)

```


## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `transactions`.

- Time complexity: O((n−1)!)
    
    - In `dfs(0)`, there exists a maximum of n−1 persons as possible `nxt`, each of which leads to a recursive call to `dfs(1)`. Therefore, we have dfs(0)=(n−1)⋅dfs(1)=(n−1)⋅((n−2)⋅dfs(2))=(n−1)⋅(n−2)⋅((n−3)⋅dfs(3))=...=(n−1)!⋅dfs(n−1)
        
    - `dfs(n - 1)` can be determined in O(1) time.
        
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    - Both `balance_map` and `balance_list` possess at most n net balances.
    - The space complexity of a recursive call relies on the maximum depth of the recursive call stack, which is equal to n. As each recursive call increments `cur` by 1, and each level consumes a constant amount of space.


## Approach 2: Dynamic Programming (太复杂了)

```python

class Solution:
    def minTransfers(self, transactions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        balance_map = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for a, b, amount in transactions:
            balance_map[a] += amount
            balance_map[b] -= amount
        
        balance_list = [amount for amount in balance_map.values() if amount!=0]
        n = len(balance_list)
        
        memo = [-1] * (1 << n)
        memo[0] = 0
        
        def dfs(total_mask):
            # pruning: If already solved this subset (memoized), return cached result
            if memo[total_mask] != -1:
                return memo[total_mask]
            balance_sum, answer = 0, 0

            # Try removing each person i from the current subset (total_mask) one at a time
            for i in range(n):
                cur_bit = 1 << i
                # Check if person i is still in the subset (bit is 1)
                if total_mask & cur_bit:
                    # Add person i's balance to the running sum for this subset
                    balance_sum += balance_list[i]
                    # Recursively compute how many zero‐sum groups we can form
                    # from the remaining people (with person i removed),
                    # and take the best (maximum) among all choices
                    answer = max(answer, dfs(total_mask ^ cur_bit))

            # If the total balance of total_mask is 0, increment answer by 1.
            memo[total_mask] = answer + (balance_sum == 0)
            return memo[total_mask]
        
        return n - dfs((1 << n) - 1)

```


## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `transactions`.

- Time complexity: O(n⋅2^n)
    
    - We build `memo`, an array of size O(2n) as memory, equal to the number of possible states. Each state is computed with a traverse through `balance_list`, which takes O(n) time.
- Space complexity: O(2^n)
    
    - The length of `memo` is 2^n.
    - The space complexity of a recursive call depends on the maximum depth of the recursive call stack, which is n. As each recursive call removes one set bit from `total_mask`. Therefore, at most O(n) levels of recursion will be created, and each level consumes a constant amount of space.
