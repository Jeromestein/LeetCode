Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize tortoise and hare pointers
        tortoise = head
        hare = head

        # Move tortoise one step and hare two steps
        while hare and hare.next:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next.next

            # Check if the hare meets the tortoise
            if tortoise == hare:
                break

        # Check if there is no cycle
        if not hare or not hare.next:
            return None

        # Reset either tortoise or hare pointer to the head
        hare = head

        # Move both pointers one step until they meet again
        while tortoise != hare:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next

        # Return the node where the cycle begins
        return tortoise
```

## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the total number of nodes in the linked list.

- Time complexity: O(n).

The algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use two pointers (the "hare" and the "tortoise") to traverse the list. The slow pointer (tortoise) will go through the list only once until it meets the hare. Therefore, this phase runs in O(n) time.

In the second phase, we again have two pointers traversing the list at the same speed until they meet. The maximum distance to be covered in this phase will not be greater than the length of the list (recall that the hare just needs to get back to the entrance of the cycle). So, this phase also runs in O(n) time.

As a result, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(n)+O(n), which simplifies to O(n).

- Space complexity: O(1).

The space complexity is constant, O(1), because we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the slow and fast pointers. No additional space is used that scales with the input size. So the space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), which means it uses constant space.
