# Approach 1: Recursive Postorder Traversal

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def postorderTraversalHelper(self, currentNode, result):
        # Base case: if the node is null, return
        if not currentNode:
            return
        # Traverse left subtree
        self.postorderTraversalHelper(currentNode.left, result)
        # Traverse right subtree
        self.postorderTraversalHelper(currentNode.right, result)
        # Add the current node's value to the result list
        result.append(currentNode.val)

    def postorderTraversal(self, root):
        result = []
        # Start traversal from root
        self.postorderTraversalHelper(root, result)
        return result
```

## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is visited once during the traversal, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (e.g., a completely unbalanced tree), the recursion stack could hold all `n` nodes.

# Single Stack Postorder Traversal (Iterative)



```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []

        # If the root is null, return an empty list
        if root is None:
            return result

        # To keep track of the previously processed node
        previous_node = None
        # Stack to manage the traversal
        traversal_stack = []

        # Process nodes until both the root is null and the stack is empty
        while root is not None or len(traversal_stack) > 0:
            # Traverse to the leftmost node
            if root is not None:
                traversal_stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            else:
                # Peek at the top node of the stack
                root = traversal_stack[-1]

                # If there is no right child or the right child was already processed
                if root.right is None or root.right == previous_node:
                    result.append(root.val)
                    traversal_stack.pop()
                    previous_node = root
                    root = None  # Ensure we don’t traverse again from this node
                else:
                    # Move to the right child
                    root = root.right

        return result

```
## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is processed a constant number of times. The stack operations and pointer manipulations also contribute to a linear time complexity with respect to `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    Although this approach uses only a single stack, in the worst case, the stack can still hold up to `n` nodes, so the space complexity remains O(n). However, this approach optimizes the space usage compared to using two stacks.


# Morris Traversal (No stack)

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root):
        result = []

        # If the root is None, return an empty list
        if not root:
            return result

        # Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases
        dummy_node = TreeNode(-1)
        dummy_node.left = root
        root = dummy_node

        # Traverse the tree
        while root:
            if root.left:  # If the current node has a left child
                predecessor = root.left

                # Find the rightmost node in the left subtree or the thread back to the current node
                while predecessor.right and predecessor.right != root:
                    predecessor = predecessor.right

                # Create a thread if it doesn't exist
                if predecessor.right == None:
                    predecessor.right = root
                    root = root.left
                else:
                    # Process the nodes in the left subtree
                    node = predecessor
                    self._reverse_subtree_links(root.left, predecessor)

                    # Add nodes from right to left
                    while node != root.left:
                        result.append(node.val)
                        node = node.right
                    result.append(node.val)  # Add root.left's value
                    self._reverse_subtree_links(predecessor, root.left)
                    predecessor.right = None
                    root = root.right
            else:
                # Move to the right child if there's no left child
                root = root.right

        return result

    def _reverse_subtree_links(self, start_node, end_node):
        if start_node == end_node:
            return  # If the start and end nodes are the same, no need to reverse

        prev = None
        current = start_node
        next = None

        # Reverse the direction of the pointers in the subtree
        while current != end_node:
            next = current.right
            current.right = prev
            prev = current
            current = next
        # Reverse the last node
        current.right = prev
```

## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is visited a constant number of times, and the traversal through the tree is linear in terms of `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The Morris Traversal technique uses no extra space beyond the pointers used for traversal. The temporary modifications to the tree structure are reversed before the traversal ends, so the space complexity is constant.
