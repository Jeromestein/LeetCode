`Unknown`

Given an array of strings `words` (**without duplicates**), return _all the **concatenated words** in the given list of_ `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
- `1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105`

                # mark dp[j] = True
                if word[i:j] in word_set:
                    dp[j] = True
                    # Early exit: if we've reached the end, it's formable
                    if j == n:
                        return True 
        return False

## Complexity Analysis

Here, N is the total number of strings in the array `words`, namely `words.length`, and M is the length of the longest string in the array `words`.

- Time complexity: O(M^3⋅N).

Although we use HashSet, we need to consider the cost to calculate the hash value of a string internally which would be O(M). So putting all words into the HashSet takes O(N∗M).  
For each word, the i and j loops take O(M^2). The internal logic to take the substring and search in the HashSet needs to calculate the hash value for the substring too, and it should take another O(M), so for each word, the time complexity is O(M^3) and the total time complexity for N words is O(M^3⋅N)

- Space complexity: O(N⋅M).
    
    This is just the space to save all words in the `dictionary`, if we don't take M as a constant.
