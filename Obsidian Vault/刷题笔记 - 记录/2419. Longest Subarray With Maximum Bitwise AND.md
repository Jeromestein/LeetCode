You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`.

Consider a **non-empty** subarray from `nums` that has the **maximum** possible **bitwise AND**.

- In other words, let `k` be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of **any** subarray of `nums`. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to `k` should be considered.

Return _the length of the **longest** such subarray_.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 4.
The longest subarray with that value is [4], so we return 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`

    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # is this just about the biggest elements?
        max_num=1
        max_length=0
        n=len(nums)
        i=0

                max_length=max(max_length,length)
            elif max_num<nums[i]:
                max_num=nums[i]
                length=0
                while i<n and nums[i]==max_num:
                    length+=1
                    i+=1
                max_length=length
            else:
                i+=1
            
        return max_length

- Time Complexity: O(N)
    
    The time complexity is O(N) because the function processes each element of the `nums` list exactly once. This is done through a single loop that iterates over the array. Each operation inside the loop—whether it's comparisons, assignments, or finding the maximum—takes constant time. As a result, the total time required scales linearly with the size of the input array.
    
- Space Complexity: O(1)
    
    The function uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input array `nums`. Specifically, it only requires a few variables (`max_val`, `ans`, `current_streak`, and `num`) to keep track of intermediate values. This fixed space usage means the space complexity remains constant.
