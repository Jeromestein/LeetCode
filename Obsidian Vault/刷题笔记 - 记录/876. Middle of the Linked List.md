Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow= fast=head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next

        return slow
