`Unknown`

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/"), but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

```python

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1

        while l < r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            # All the integers of nums are unique.
            # In this case, we cannot tell which half has the minimum, 
            # so just move right pointer 
            if nums[mid] == nums[r]:
                r -= 1
            elif nums[mid] < nums[r]:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid+1

        return nums[l]

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity : in most cases, O(logN).  In worst cases, O(n).
- Space complexity : O(1) since it's a constant space solution.
