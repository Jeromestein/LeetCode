`Unknown`

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A **k-distant index** is an index `i` of `nums` for which there exists at least one index `j` such that `|i - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key`.

Return _a list of all k-distant indices sorted in **increasing order**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `key` is an integer from the array `nums`.
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

### Approach 2: One-time Traversal

#### Intuition

Let's assume the length of the array nums is n. Then, for any index j that satisfies nums[j]=key, all indices within the closed interval [max(0,j−k),min(n−1,j+k)] are K-neighbor indices (the maximum and minimum functions are used here to ensure the indices are valid).

So, we can find all indices j such that nums[j]=key by traversing the array nums once, and then adding the integers within the corresponding interval to res. However, this can still lead to the possibility of duplicate indices being added to the answer array. To avoid this, we can use r to represent the smallest index that has not yet been determined to be a K-nearest neighbor index. Before the traversal begins, let r=0. Whenever we reach an index j that satisfies the condition, we just need to add all indices within the closed interval [max(0,j−k),min(n−1,j+k)] in order to res, starting from r, and at the same time, update r to min(n−1,j+k)+1. After the traversal is complete, res will contain all K-nearest neighbor indices, sorted in ascending order and without duplicates.

```python
class Solution:
    def findKDistantIndices(self, nums: List[int], key: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        res=list()
        right=0
        n=len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i]==key:
                left=max(right, i-k)
                right=min(n-1, i+k)+1
                for j in range(left, right):
                    res.append(j)

        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the array nums.

- Time complexity: O(n).
    
    We only need to traverse the array once.
    
- Space complexity: O(1).
    
    The output array is not counted in the space complexity.
