Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:

- The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
- The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.

**Note:** A subtree must include all of its descendants.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/17/tmp.jpg)**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:** Can you figure out ways to solve it with `O(n)` time complexity?

#         self.left = left

    def largestBSTSubtree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.ans = 0

        def dfs(node):
            """
            Returns (is_bst, size, min_val, max_val) for the subtree rooted at node.
            """
            if not node:

            # Check BST property including whole‐subtree min/max
            if l_bst and r_bst and l_max < node.val < r_min:
                size = l_size + r_size + 1
                # Update global maximum
                self.ans = max(self.ans, size)
                # Return BST info
                return True, size, min(l_min, node.val), max(r_max, node.val)
            else:
                # Not a BST: size/min/max returned here are irrelevant
                return False, 0, 0, 0

        dfs(root)
        return self.ans

## **Complexity Analysis**

Here, N and H are the number of nodes and the max height of the given tree respectively.

- Time complexity: O(N).
    
    - In `largestBSTSubtree` function, we traverse all nodes of the given tree, and for each node, we find if the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST which takes O(1) time and if it is a BST, we calculate the number of nodes in this subtree which also takes O(1) time. Thus, for N nodes this algorithm takes O(N) time.
- Space complexity: O(N).
    
    - Recursive stack can take at most O(H) space; in the worst-case scenario, the height of the tree will equal N.
