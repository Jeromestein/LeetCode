A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞ guarantees at least one peak
        left, right = 0, len(nums)-1

        # check if the slope is rising to the right or falling to the left
        while left < right:
            mid = (left+right)//2
            # If the slope is rising to the right, a peak must lie in (mid+1, r]
            # Of course, nums[mid+1] exists
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                right = mid

        return left
```
