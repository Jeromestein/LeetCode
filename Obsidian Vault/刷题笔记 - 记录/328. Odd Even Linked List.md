Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # build 2 lists, and link together in the end
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        odd=head
        even=head.next
        evenHead= even 

        while even and even.next:
            odd.next=even.next
            odd=odd.next
            even.next=odd.next
            even=even.next

        odd.next=evenHead

        return head
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(n). There are total n nodes and we visit each node once.
    
- Space complexity : O(1). All we need is the four pointers.
