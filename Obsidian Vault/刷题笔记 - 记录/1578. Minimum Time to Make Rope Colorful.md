`Unknown`

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the balloons at indices 0 and 4. Each balloons takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`
- `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.

            # Increment total_time by the smaller one.
            # Update curr_max_time as the larger one.

        # Return total_time as the minimum removal time.
        return total_time
