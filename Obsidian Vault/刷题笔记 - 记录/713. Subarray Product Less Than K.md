`Unknown`

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than_ `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= 106`

```python

class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Handle edge cases where k is 0 or 1 (no subarrays possible)
        if k <= 1:
            return 0

        total_count = 0
        product = 1

        # Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window
        left = 0
        for right, num in enumerate(nums):
            product *= num  # Expand the window by including the element at the right pointer

            # Shrink the window from the left while the product is greater than or equal to k
            while product >= k:
                product //= nums[left]  # Remove the element at the left pointer from the product
                left += 1

            # Update the total count by adding the number of valid subarrays with the current window size
            total_count += right - left + 1  # right - left + 1 represents the current window size

        return total_count
```


## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `nums`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    The algorithm iterates through the input array `nums` using a single for loop. Inside the loop, there are nested operations for shrinking the window, but since `left` is incremented a total number of `n` times during the whole array traversal, each element in the array is visited at most twice.
    
    The nested loop terminates when the product becomes less than `k`, and this can only happen at most `n` times total (once for each element). Therefore, the overall time complexity is 2n, which we describe as O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `totalCount`, `product`, `left`, and `right`. These variables do not depend on the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is considered constant, denoted as O(1).


# Template: #sliding-window
```python

def count_subarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    left = 0
    window_value = ..  # e.g. sum = 0 / prod = 1 / distinct_count = 0 / …

    while right < n:
        # 1) add nums[right] 
        window_value = add(window_value, nums[right])

        # 2) if not valid, move left one step
        while left <= right and not is_window_valid(window_value):
            window_value = remove(window_value, nums[left])
            left += 1

        # 3) Now, all subarraries in [left..right] are valid
        # the # of subarrays: right−left+1
        count += right - left + 1
        
        right+=1

    return count
```
