A **fancy string** is a string where no **three** **consecutive** characters are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the **minimum** possible number of characters from `s` to make it **fancy**.

Return _the final string after the deletion_. It can be shown that the answer will always be **unique**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

        n=len(s)
        if n<3:
            return s
        
        res=s[0]
        cnt=1
        prev=s[0]
        for i in range(1,n):
            if s[i]==prev:
                cnt+=1
            else:
                prev=s[i]
                cnt=1

        return res

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the length of the string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, iterating through the string from the first to the last character. For each character, it performs constant time operations. Since there are `n` characters in the string, the overall time complexity is given by O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The `ans` string stores the resulting string, which in the worst case, could be the same size as the input string `s` (if no deletions are made). Therefore, the space required is O(n).
