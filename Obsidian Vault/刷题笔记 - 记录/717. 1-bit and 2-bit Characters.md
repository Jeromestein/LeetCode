`Unknown`

We have two special characters:

- The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
- The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Given a binary array `bits` that ends with `0`, return `true` if the last character must be a one-bit character.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bits.length <= 1000`
- `bits[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

#### Intuition

When reading from the `i`-th position, if `bits[i] == 0`, the next character must be at `i + 1`, because `0` is 1-bit; else if `bits[i] == 1`, the next character must be at `i + 2`, because `1` is only present in 2-bit characters `10` and `11`. We increment our read-pointer `i` to the start of the next character appropriately. At the end, if our pointer is at `bits.length - 1`, then the last character must have a size of 1 bit.

```python

class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        n=len(bits)
        # find last character
        i=0
        while i<n-1:
            if bits[i]==0:
                i+=1
            if bits[i]==1:
                i+=2

        return i==n-1
```
