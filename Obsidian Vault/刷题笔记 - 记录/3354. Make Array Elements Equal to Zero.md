`Unknown`

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Start by selecting a starting position `curr` such that `nums[curr] == 0`, and choose a movement **direction** of either left or right.

After that, you repeat the following process:

- If `curr` is out of the range `[0, n - 1]`, this process ends.
- If `nums[curr] == 0`, move in the current direction by **incrementing** `curr` if you are moving right, or **decrementing** `curr` if you are moving left.
- Else if `nums[curr] > 0`:
    - Decrement `nums[curr]` by 1.
    - **Reverse** your movement direction (left becomes right and vice versa).
    - Take a step in your new direction.

A selection of the initial position `curr` and movement direction is considered **valid** if every element in `nums` becomes 0 by the end of the process.

Return the number of possible **valid** selections.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,2,0,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The only possible valid selections are the following:

- Choose `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the left.
    - `[1,0,2,**0**,3] -> [1,0,**2**,0,3] -> [1,0,1,**0**,3] -> [1,0,1,0,**3**] -> [1,0,1,**0**,2] -> [1,0,**1**,0,2] -> [1,0,0,**0**,2] -> [1,0,0,0,**2**] -> [1,0,0,**0**,1] -> [1,0,**0**,0,1] -> [1,**0**,0,0,1] -> [**1**,0,0,0,1] -> [0,**0**,0,0,1] -> [0,0,**0**,0,1] -> [0,0,0,**0**,1] -> [0,0,0,0,**1**] -> [0,0,0,0,0]`.
- Choose `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the right.
    - `[1,0,2,**0**,3] -> [1,0,2,0,**3**] -> [1,0,2,**0**,2] -> [1,0,**2**,0,2] -> [1,0,1,**0**,2] -> [1,0,1,0,**2**] -> [1,0,1,**0**,1] -> [1,0,**1**,0,1] -> [1,0,0,**0**,1] -> [1,0,0,0,**1**] -> [1,0,0,**0**,0] -> [1,0,**0**,0,0] -> [1,**0**,0,0,0] -> [**1**,0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0,0].`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,4,0,4,1,0]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There are no possible valid selections.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- There is at least one element `i` where `nums[i] == 0`.
