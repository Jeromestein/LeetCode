`Unknown`

Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return _an array of the_ `k`_-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort_ `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
- All integers in `arr` are unique (i.e. `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`).

```python
class Solution:
    def pancakeSort(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n=len(arr)
        res=[]

        for i in range(n,0,-1):
            idx=arr.index(i)
            arr[0:idx+1]=reversed(arr[0:idx+1])
            res.append(idx+1)
            arr[0:i]=reversed(arr[0:i])
            res.append(i)

        return res
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

Let N be the length of the input list.

- Time Complexity: O(N2)
    
    - In the algorithm, we run a loop with N iterations.
        
    - Within each iteration, we are dealing with the corresponding prefix of the list.  
        Here we denote the length of the prefix as k, _e.g._ in the first iteration, the length of the prefix is N. While in the second iteration, the length of the prefix is N−1.
        
    - Within each iteration, we have operations whose time complexity is linear to the length of the prefix, such as iterating through the prefix to find the index, or flipping the entire prefix _etc._ Hence, for each iteration, its time complexity would be O(k)
        
    - To sum up all iterations, we have the overall time complexity of the algorithm as ∑k=1N​O(k)=O(N2).
        
- Space Complexity: O(N)
    
    - Within the algorithm, we use a list to maintain the final results, which is proportional to the number of pancake flips.
        
    - For each round of iteration, at most we would add two pancake flips. Therefore, the maximal number of pancake flips needed would be 2⋅N.
        
    - As a result, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(N). If one does not take into account the space required to hold the result of the function, then one could consider the above algorithm as a constant space solution.
