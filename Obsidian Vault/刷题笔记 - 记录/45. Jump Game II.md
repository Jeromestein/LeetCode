`Unknown`

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at index 0.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at index `i`, you can jump to any index `(i + j)` where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
- `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach index_ `n - 1`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index `n - 1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

```python

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # The starting range of the first jump is [0, 0]
        answer, n = 0, len(nums)
        cur_end, cur_far = 0, 0

        for i in range(n - 1):
            # Update the farthest reachable index of this jump.
            cur_far = max(cur_far, i + nums[i])

            # If we finish the starting range of this jump,
            # Move on to the starting range of the next jump.
            if i == cur_end:
                answer += 1
                cur_end = cur_far

        return answer
