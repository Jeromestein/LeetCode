`Unknown`

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:**

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

```python
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        count1=Counter(nums1)
        count2=Counter(nums2)
        res=[]
        for num in count1:
            if num in count2:
                length=min(count1[num], count2[num])
                for i in range(length):
                    res.append(num)

        return res
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(n+m), where n and m are the lengths of the arrays. We iterate through the first, and then through the second array; insert and lookup operations in the hash map take a constant time.
    
- Space Complexity: O(min(n,m)). We use hash map to store numbers (and their counts) from the smaller array.
