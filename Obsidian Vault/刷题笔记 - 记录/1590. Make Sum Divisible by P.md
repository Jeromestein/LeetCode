Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the **smallest** subarray (possibly **empty**) such that the **sum** of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is **not** allowed to remove the whole array.

Return _the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or_ `-1` _if it's impossible_.

A **subarray** is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= p <= 109`

```python

class Solution:
    def minSubarray(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total_sum = 0

        # Step 1: Calculate total sum and target remainder
        for num in nums:
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % p

        target = total_sum % p
        if target == 0:
            return 0  # The array is already divisible by p

        # Step 2: Use a dict to track prefix sum mod p
        mod_map = {
            0: -1
        }  # To handle the case where the whole prefix is the answer
        current_sum = 0
        min_len = n

        # Step 3: Iterate over the array
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = (current_sum + nums[i]) % p

            # Calculate what we need to remove
            needed = (current_sum - target + p) % p

            # If we have seen the needed remainder, we can consider this subarray
            if needed in mod_map:
                min_len = min(min_len, i - mod_map[needed])

            # Store the current remainder and index
            mod_map[current_sum] = i

        # Step 4: Return result
        return -1 if min_len == n else min_len
