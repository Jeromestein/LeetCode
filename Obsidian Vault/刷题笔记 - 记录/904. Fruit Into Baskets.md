`Unknown`

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return _the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`

```python


class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(fruits)
        basket = {}
        left = right = res = 0
        for right in range(n):
            basket[fruits[right]] = basket.get(fruits[right], 0) + 1
            while len(basket) > 2:
                basket[fruits[left]] -= 1
                if basket[fruits[left]] == 0:
                    del basket[fruits[left]]
                left += 1

            res = max(res, right - left + 1)
        return res

```

## Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input array `fruits`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    - Similarly, both indexes `left` and `right` are only monotonically increasing during the iteration, thus we have at most 2⋅n steps,
    - At each step, we update the hash set by addition or deletion of one fruit, which takes constant time. Note that the number of additions or deletions does not exceed n.
    - To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    - We maintain the number of fruit types contained in the window in time. Therefore, at any given time, there are at most 3 types of fruits in the window or the hash map `basket`.
    - In summary, the space complexity is O(1).
