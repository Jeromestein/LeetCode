You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.

- For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `"**b**a**bab**c**ba**"`.

Return _the **longest subsequence repeated**_ `k` _times in string_ `s`_. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string_.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/30/longest-subsequence-repeat-k-times.png)

```
Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
Output: "let"
Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
"let" is the lexicographically largest one.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bb", k = 2
Output: "b"
Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ab", k = 2
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == s.length`
- `2 <= n, k <= 2000`
- `2 <= n < k * 8`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Approach: Brute-force Enumeration

#### Intuition

According to the problem statement, the task is to find the longest subsequence of characters that appears at least k times and is lexicographically largest. Therefore, the characters that make up this subsequence must appear at least k times in s. Characters that appear fewer than k times in s can be filtered out directly.

Let the length of s be n. We only consider characters in s that appear at least k times. The longest valid subsequence can only be composed of these characters, and their count cannot exceed ⌊kn​⌋. Since the problem states that n<8k, the length of the longest valid subsequence must be at most 7, and the number of qualifying characters is also at most 7. Therefore, the number of candidate subsequences does not exceed 27=128, making it feasible to use brute-force enumeration to find the correct answer.

We start by counting the frequency of each character to identify those that meet the required threshold. Then, we enumerate all possible permutations formed from any combination of these characters. For each such permutation permutationi​, we check whether it appears in s at least k times. Among all valid permutations, we return the one with the maximum length and the greatest lexicographical order.

To generate all permutations, we can use a queue. Each time, we pop the current valid subsequence curr from the queue and attempt to append a valid character c to form a new string next. If next appears in s at least k times, we push it into the queue to continue expanding it. By enumerating characters in reverse lexicographical order (from largest to smallest), we ensure that the largest lexicographical string is generated first. This allows us to return the longest and lexicographically largest valid subsequence efficiently.

```python
	# 检查 next 作为“子系列”是否在字符串 s 中出现 k 次
	# Create an iterator over s to check subsequence membership
	it = iter(s)
	# Check if `next` repeated k times can be found as a subsequence
	# i.e., next*next*... (k times) each char in order
	if all(char in it for char in next * k):
		# If valid, enqueue for further extension
		q.append(next)
```


```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        ans = ""  
        # 1. Filter out characters that appear at least k times,
        #    sort them in descending order for lexicographical control.
        candidate = sorted(
            [char for char, freq in Counter(s).items() if freq >= k],
            reverse=True
        )
        # 2. Initialize a queue with each single-character candidate
        # For deque:
        # •	popleft()：O(1)
        # •	append()：O(1)
        q = deque(candidate)

        # 3. BFS: try extending each current string by one more char
        while q:
            curr = q.popleft()  
            # If this candidate is longer than previous best, update answer
            if len(curr) > len(ans):
                ans = curr

            # For each possible next character, form a new candidate
            for char in candidate:
                next = curr + char 
                # Create an iterator over s to check subsequence membership
                it = iter(s)
                # Check if `next` repeated k times can be found as a subsequence
                # i.e., next*next*... (k times) each char in order
                if all(char in it for char in next * k):
                    # If valid, enqueue for further extension
                    q.append(next)
```

#### Complexity Analysis
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/solutions/6882480/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-06-27

Let n be the length of the given string, and let k be the given number.

- Time complexity: O(n⋅⌊n/k​⌋!).
    
    According to the analysis, the length of the subsequence does not exceed m=⌊n/k​⌋. At this point, there are i! combinations of strings of length i, so the total number of possible string combinations is
    



Therefore, there are at most 2m! candidate subsequences. After generating the candidate subsequences, it still takes O(n) time to match and check them, so the total time complexity is O(n⋅⌊n/k​⌋!).

- Space complexity: O(⌊n/k​⌋!).
    
    There can be at most ⌊n/k​⌋! candidate subsequences, and at most ⌊n/k​⌋! elements can exist in the queue. Thus, the space complexity is O(⌊n/k​⌋!).
