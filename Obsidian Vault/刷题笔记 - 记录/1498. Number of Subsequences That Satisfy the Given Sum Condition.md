`Unknown`

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return _the number of **non-empty** subsequences of_ `nums` _such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to_ `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `1 <= target <= 106`

## **Sort → Two pointers → Count valid subsequences using powers of 2 → Return result modulo 10^9 + 7.**

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, nums, target):
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)

        power = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            power[i] = (power[i - 1] * 2) % mod

        left, right = 0, n - 1
        result = 0

        while left <= right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] <= target:
                result = (result + power[right - left]) % mod
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return result
```

# Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity:**O(n log n)** for sorting + **O(n)** for two pointers = `O(n log n)`

- Space complexity:`O(n)` (power array). We can save the power array, so it is O(1).
