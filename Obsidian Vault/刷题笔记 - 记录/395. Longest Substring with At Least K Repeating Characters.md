Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 105`

# Divide And Conquer

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if not s: return 0
        for c in set(s):
            if s.count(c) < k:
                return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
        return len(s)
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity : O(N2), where N is the length of string s. Though the algorithm performs better in most cases, the worst case time complexity is still O(N2).

In cases where we perform split at every index, the maximum depth of recursive call could be O(N). For each recursive call it takes O(N) time to build the `countMap` resulting in O(n2) time complexity.

- Space Complexity: O(N) This is the space used to store the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of recursive call stack would be O(N).

# Slide Window

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # If k is 0, every substring is valid
        if k == 0:
            return len(s)

        n = len(s)
        res = 0
        # Maximum distinct characters we need to consider is limited by the string itself
        max_unique = len(set(s))

        # Try every possible target number of distinct characters in the window
        for target in range(1, max_unique + 1):
            count = defaultdict(int)
            left = 0
            right = 0
            unique = 0         # current number of distinct characters in window
            no_less_than_k = 0 # number of characters in window with freq >= k

            # Expand window by moving right
            while right < n:
                c = s[right]
                if count[c] == 0:
                    unique += 1
                count[c] += 1
                if count[c] == k:
                    no_less_than_k += 1
                right += 1

                # Shrink window from the left if we exceed target distinct chars
                while unique > target:
                    d = s[left]
                    if count[d] == k:
                        no_less_than_k -= 1
                    count[d] -= 1
                    if count[d] == 0:
                        unique -= 1
                    left += 1

                # If window has exactly 'target' distinct chars,
                # and all of them appear at least k times,
                # update the maximum length
                if unique == target and no_less_than_k == target:
                    res = max(res, right - left)

        return res

```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity : O(n), O(maxUnique⋅N). We iterate over the string of length N, maxUnqiue times. Ideally, the number of unique characters in the string would not be more than 26 `(a to z)`. Hence, the time complexity is approximately O(26⋅N) = O(N)
    
- Space Complexity: O(1) We use constant extra space of size 26 to store the `countMap`.


# Template: #sliding-window
```python

def count_subarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    left = 0
    window_value = ..  # e.g. sum = 0 / prod = 1 / distinct_count = 0 / …

    while right < n:
        # 1) add nums[right] 
        window_value = add(window_value, nums[right])

        # 2) if not valid, move left one step
        while left <= right and not is_window_valid(window_value):
            window_value = remove(window_value, nums[left])
            left += 1

        # 3) Now, all subarraries in [left..right] are valid
        # the # of subarrays: right−left+1
        count += right - left + 1
        
        right+=1

    return count
