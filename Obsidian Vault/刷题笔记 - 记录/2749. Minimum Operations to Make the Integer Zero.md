You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and subtract `2i + num2` from `num1`.

Return _the integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations needed to make_ `num1` _equal to_ `0`.

If it is impossible to make `num1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = 3, num2 = -2
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 3, 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1.
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 1, 1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1.
- We choose i = 0 and subtract 20 + (-2) from -1, (-1) - (1 + (-2)) = 0.
It can be proven, that 3 is the minimum number of operations that we need to perform.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num1 = 5, num2 = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proven, that it is impossible to make 5 equal to 0 with the given operation.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num1 <= 109`
- `-109 <= num2 <= 109`
