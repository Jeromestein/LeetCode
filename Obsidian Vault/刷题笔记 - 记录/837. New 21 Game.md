Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` **or more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.73278
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= n <= 104`
- `1 <= maxPts <= 104`

```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, n: int, k: int, maxPts: int) -> float:
        # If Alice stops immediately, she always has 0 points ≤ n
        if k == 0:
            return 1.0

        # dp[x] is the probability of having exactly x points
        dp = [0.0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1.0

        # window_sum = sum of dp[x - 1], dp[x - 2], …, dp[x - maxPts]
        # but only for states where x - i < k (she is still drawing)
        window_sum = 1.0
        result = 0.0

        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            # Compute dp[x] in O(1) by dividing the window sum by maxPts
            dp[x] = window_sum / maxPts

            # If x is still below k, Alice continues drawing, so include dp[x]
            if x < k:
                window_sum += dp[x]
            else:
                # Once x ≥ k, Alice stops drawing; accumulate to final result
                result += dp[x]

            # Slide the window: remove dp[x - maxPts] when it falls out
            if x - maxPts >= 0 and x - maxPts < k:
                window_sum -= dp[x - maxPts]

        return result
