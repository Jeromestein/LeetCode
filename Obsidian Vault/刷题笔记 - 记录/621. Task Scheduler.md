You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of **at least** `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the **minimum** number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tasks.length <= 104`
- `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.
- `0 <= n <= 100`

```python

class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Create a frequency array to keep track of the count of each task
        freq = [0] * 26
        for task in tasks:
            freq[ord(task) - ord('A')] += 1

        # Sort the frequency array in non-decreasing order
        freq.sort()
        # Calculate the maximum frequency of any task
        max_freq = freq[25] - 1
        # Calculate the number of idle slots that will be required
        idle_slots = max_freq * n
        # Iterate over the frequency array from the second highest frequency to the lowest frequency

        for i in range(24, -1, -1):
            # Subtract the minimum of the maximum frequency and the current frequency from the idle slots
            idle_slots -= min(max_freq, freq[i])

        # If there are any idle slots left, add them to the total number of tasks
        return idle_slots + len(tasks) if idle_slots > 0 else len(tasks)

```


## Complexity Analysis

Let the number of tasks be N. There are up to 26 distinct tasks because the tasks are represented by the letters A to Z.

- Time complexity: O(N)
    
    The time complexity of the algorithm is O(26log26+N), where 26log26 is the time complexity of sorting the frequency array, and N is the length of the input task list, which is the dominating term.
    
- Space complexity: O(26)=O(1)
    
    The frequency array has a size of 26.
    
    Note that some extra space is used when we sort arrays in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
    
    - In Python, the sort method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has O(N) additional space.
    - In Java, `Arrays.sort()` is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of O(logN) for sorting array.
    - In C++, the `sort()` function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worse-case space complexity of O(logN).
    
    We sort the frequency array, which has a size of 26. The space used for sorting takes O(26) or O(log26), which is constant, so the space complexity of the algorithm is O(26), which is constant, i.e. O(1).
