Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed** array called `powers`, composed of the **minimum** number of powers of `2` that sum to `n`. The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and there is **only one** way to form the array.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]`. Each `queries[i]` represents a query where you have to find the product of all `powers[j]` with `lefti <= j <= righti`.

Return _an array_ `answers`_, equal in length to_ `queries`_, where_ `answers[i]` _is the answer to the_ `ith` _query_. Since the answer to the `ith` query may be too large, each `answers[i]` should be returned **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
Output: [2,4,64]
Explanation:
For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] * powers[1] * powers[2] * powers[3] = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64.
Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
For n = 2, powers = [2].
The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 109 + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 109`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `0 <= starti <= endi < powers.length`

```python

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def productQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # 1) Decompose n into a list of powers of two that sum to n.
        #    Example: n = 13 (1101b) -> powers = [1, 4, 8]  (in increasing order)
        #    We scan bits from least significant to most significant.
        powers: List[int] = []
        bit_value = 1  # represents 2^k for the current bit position
        while n > 0:
            if n & 1:                 # if the current bit is set
                powers.append(bit_value)
            n >>= 1                    # move to next bit
            bit_value <<= 1            # next power of two

        m = len(powers)

        # 2) Precompute range products for all subarrays powers[i..j].
        #    range_prod[i][j] stores (powers[i] * ... * powers[j]) % MOD.
        #    Complexity: O(m^2). Here m = number of set bits in the original n,
        #    which is tiny (<= 31 for 32-bit range), so this is perfectly fine.
        range_prod = [[0] * m for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            cur = 1
            for j in range(i, m):
                cur = (cur * powers[j]) % MOD
                range_prod[i][j] = cur

        # 3) Answer each query [L, R] in O(1) by a table lookup.
        #    Each query asks for product(powers[L..R]) modulo MOD.
        ans: List[int] = []
        for left, right in queries:
            ans.append(range_prod[left][right])

        return ans

```


## Complexity Analysis

Let q be the length of the array queries.

- Time complexity: O(log2n+q)
    
    After preprocessing, we don't need to traverse every time when querying.
    
- Space complexity: O(log2n)
    
    This is the space required to store the preprocessed results.
