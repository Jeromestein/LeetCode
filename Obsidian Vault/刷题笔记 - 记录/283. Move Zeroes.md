Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # nums before ptr1 r zero-free
        ptr1=0
        n=len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                nums[i], nums[ptr1]=  nums[ptr1],nums[i]
                ptr1+=1
        
        return
```


## **Complexity Analysis**

Space Complexity : O(1). Only constant space is used.

Time Complexity: O(n). However, the total number of operations are optimal. The total operations (array writes) that code does is Number of non-0 elements.This gives us a much better best-case (when most of the elements are 0) complexity than last solution. However, the worst-case (when all elements are non-0) complexity for both the algorithms is same.
