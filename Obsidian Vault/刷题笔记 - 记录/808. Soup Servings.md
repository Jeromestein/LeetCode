`Unknown`

You have two soups, **A** and **B**, each starting with `n` mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen _at random_, each with probability `0.25` **independent** of all previous turns:

- pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B
- pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B
- pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B
- pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B

**Note:**

- There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.
- The amounts from A and B are poured _simultaneously_ during the turn.
- If an operation asks you to pour **more than** you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.

The process stops immediately after any turn in which _one of the soups_ is used up.

Return the probability that A is used up _before_ B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the **same turn**. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 50
Output: 0.62500
Explanation: 
If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 100
Output: 0.71875
Explanation: 
If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.
If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.
If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 109`

```python

class Solution:
    def soupServings(self, n: int) -> float:
        m = ceil(n / 25)
        dp = {}

        def calculate_dp(i, j):
            return (dp[max(0, i - 4)][j] + dp[max(0, i - 3)][j - 1] +
                    dp[max(0, i - 2)][max(0, j - 2)]
                    + dp[i - 1][max(0, j - 3)]) / 4

        dp[0] = {0: 0.5}
        for k in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[0][k] = 1
            dp[k] = {0: 0}
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[j][k] = calculate_dp(j, k)
                dp[k][j] = calculate_dp(k, j)
            if dp[k][k] > 1 - 1e-5:
                return 1
        return dp[m][m]
