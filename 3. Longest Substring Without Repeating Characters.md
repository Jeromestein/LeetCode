**Companies**

`adobe` | `amazon` | `bloomberg` | `yelp`

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n=len(s)
        left=right=maxLen=0
        # recentIdx[s[right]]=right+1, stores the next idx of the char
        recentIdx={}
        while right < n:                
            if s[right] in recentIdx:
                left=max(left, recentIdx[s[right]])
                
            recentIdx[s[right]]=right+1
            maxLen=max(maxLen, right-left+1)
            right+=1

        return maxLen
```


## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity : O(n). Index j will iterate n times.
    
- Space complexity : O(min(m,n)<26)=O(1). Same as the previous approach.
