            for i in range(n):
                # Each skill i takes (skill[i] * mana[j]) extra time
                # The start time for the current skill must be after all previous tasks are finished,

            # After the forward pass, record the total time for the last skill
            times[n - 1] = cur_time

            # Backward pass: propagate adjusted completion times for earlier skills
            # (so that the "end time" chain is consistent with this roundâ€™s cost)
            for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                # Each earlier skill finishes earlier by subtracting the last segment cost
                times[i] = times[i + 1] - skill[i + 1] * mana[j]
